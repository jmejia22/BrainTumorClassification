# Brain Tumor Classification
Using Deep Learning to classify whether an MRI image contains a tumor.


## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the functionality of our project through a Google Colab notebook, `brain_tumor_classification.ipynb`. We decided to use a Google Colab notebook as opposed to a jupyter notebook because Google Colab allows users to change their hardware accelerator to a GPU. Since we are building an image classification model, the GPU assists in speeding up runtime when it comes to training our model. Thus, we recommend using Google Colab and using their readily available (and free) GPU to run `brain_tumor_classification.ipynb`. To switch to Google Colab's GPU, click "Edit" --> "Notebook settings" --> "Hardware accelerator" --> "GPU" --> "Save".
